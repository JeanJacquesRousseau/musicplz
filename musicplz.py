# TODO: Compare files in /home/jjr/Music with files in Samsung Galaxy phone and upload missing one to the phone.

#TODO: before links are written in "downloaded_links.txt.", it should be compared with existing links to avoid copies of same link.

# DONE: links in youtube_links.txt should be erased and rewritten to "downloaded_links.txt" file to have increased "scan" speed.
# DONE: Fix filename using youtube title
# DONE: files should be placed in ~/Music/ ie: /home/jjr/Music/
# DONE: audio files are extracted from youtube videos as .opus
# DONE: verify local IP address of phone with MAC Address
